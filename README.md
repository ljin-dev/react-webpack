Build React Based Components with Webpack
====================================

A rapid build environment for building Ract based components in ES6.

Things the environment does:
* Installing dependent libraries
* Transpiling source files from ES6 and JSX into an ES5 bundle
* Supporting JSDom based unit testing with no need for browsers
* Supporting manual test in browsers with hot reload
* Removing dependency on Rails/Sprockets and UMD
* Supporting Visual Studio Code DTS based intellisense (code auto completion and checking)
